# Vulnerability Management

# Description
This project is a step-by-step guide to the process of vulnerability scanning and remediation. The project uses Nessus Essentials to perform credentialed scans of local virtual machine hosted on VMWare Workstation.I'll be showing the process of identifying vulnerabilities, implementing remediation solutions, and confirming their effectiveness through a rescan. This project offers a hands-on approach to my understanding of key components of the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle!

# Utilities Used
Nessus

# Environments Used
Windows 10 (21H2) |
Old version of Firefox (21H2)

# Program walk-through:
1. First I downloaded Nessus:

2. Made sure my VM had connection and got the IP address:

3. After I got my IP address, I did my first scan on Nessus with no configurations:

4. I went and made a few configurations and even downloaded an old Version of Firefox:

5. Added the Windows configurations to Nessus:

6. Ran another scan with all the updates:

Remediation
After completing scans and testing configurations on my Windows 10 virtual machine using Nessus, I took steps to address identified issues. I installed all available updates and removed an outdated version of Firefox, which posed security risks. The purpose of this was to demonstrate the impact that applications can have on a system and the vulnerabilities they can expose. In conclusion, this project showcases my understanding of vulnerability management and the fundamental knowledge of the vulnerability life cycle. It serves as a foundation for further growth and development in this field
